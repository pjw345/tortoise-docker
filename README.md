# Tortoise WoW (Docker)

> **Important:** This repository pins the server source to a tested commit. Create a full database backup before changing the image or source commit.

Run a private [Turtle WoW](https://turtle-wow.org/) server with Docker. This stack builds the pinned [pjw345/tortoise-wow](https://github.com/pjw345/tortoise-wow) Playerbot source, based on [Shyalya/tortoise-wow](https://github.com/Shyalya/tortoise-wow).

The server work and install steps come from this video:

**[Tortoise WoW / playerbots Docker setup (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/BFJes1sIi6c)**

This repository ships a Compose file. CI builds and publishes the server images to GHCR. The published binaries use a portable x86-64-v2 CPU target so the image does not depend on the instruction set of the CI runner.

## What you need

- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine with Compose v2)
- A Turtle WoW **1.18.1** client (**build 7272**)
- Client data folders: `dbc`, `maps`, `vmaps`, `mmaps`
- Several GB of free disk space

The images do not include client data. You extract that data from your game client. The video shows how to get them.

## Quick start

### 1. Get the Compose files

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pjw345/tortoise-docker
cd tortoise-docker
```

### 2. Create your settings file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

1. Set strong values for `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` and `DB_PASSWORD`.
2. Set `REALM_ADDRESS` to an address your game client can reach.
3. Set `DATA_PATH` if your client data is not in `./data`.
4. Set `AI_MIN_RANDOM_BOTS` and `AI_MAX_RANDOM_BOTS` in `.env`. These values are rendered into the server configuration when the container starts.

Use `127.0.0.1` for `REALM_ADDRESS` only when the client runs on the same machine. For another PC on your LAN, use your host LAN IP.

### 3. Add client data

Put the extracted folders here (or under your `DATA_PATH`):

```text
data/
  dbc/
  maps/
  vmaps/
  mmaps/
```

### 4. Start with Compose (or use the script)

Compose pulls the published images and starts the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
You can always feel free to start the server using start-server.cmd

The first start downloads the images (if needed) and imports the world database. This takes several minutes. This may take up to 20 minutes, if seem stuck, open powershell in server folder and run: docker compose logs --tail=20 mangosd, and see if it still INSERTs - if yes, wait more, if there are many different messages - proceed

Then watch the world server:

```bash
docker compose logs -f mangosd
```

Wait until the log shows:

```text
World server is up and running
```
This message may drown in stream of messages if you waited too long. I recommend giving it 20 minutes at first start, and then just start creating accounts. If it breaks - this may mean that server is still working with database

The first start with playerbots is slow. The server builds bot gear data before it is ready. Do not create an account before that line appears.

### 5. Create a game account

Preferably, use `create-account.cmd`, which will guide you, or:

```bash
docker compose exec -u turtle mangosd bash -c 'echo "account create myuser mypass" > /opt/turtle/run/mangosd.in'
```

Check that the account exists:

```bash
docker compose exec -T db mariadb -uroot -pYOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD -e "SELECT id, username FROM tw_logon.account;"
```

Replace `YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD` with the value of `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` from `.env`.

### 6. Connect with the client

Edit `realmlist.wtf` in your Turtle WoW client:

```text
set realmlist 127.0.0.1
```

Use the same host as `REALM_ADDRESS` in `.env`. Then log in with the account you created.

### Optional 7. Updating the server

Images are published only after a deliberate repository update or manual workflow run. Create a full database backup and verify the target image before updating an existing server.

### CPU compatibility and local builds

If an older published image exits with code 132 (`SIGILL`), rebuild it locally with the same portable target and select it with `TURTLE_IMAGE`:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg BUILD_PLAYERBOTS=ON \
  --build-arg CPU_TARGET=x86-64-v2 \
  -t tortoise-wow:playerbots-local .
TURTLE_IMAGE=tortoise-wow:playerbots-local docker compose up -d
```

The `TURTLE_IMAGE` override is optional; without it, Compose uses the published image selected by `TAG`.

## Useful settings

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `REALM_ADDRESS` | `127.0.0.1` | Host the client uses to reach the world server |
| `REALM_NAME` | `TurtleWoW` | Name of the realm in the client list |
| `DATA_PATH` | `./data` | Folder with `dbc`, `maps`, `vmaps`, `mmaps` |
| `TAG` | `playerbots` | Image variant (`playerbots` or `no-bots`) |
| `TURTLE_IMAGE` | published image from `TAG` | Optional full image reference, useful for a local build |
| `AI_PLAYERBOT_ENABLED` | `1` | Turn bots on or off (`playerbots` image only) |
| `AI_MIN_RANDOM_BOTS` / `AI_MAX_RANDOM_BOTS` | `10` / `10` | How many random bots to keep online |

Keep bot counts low for the first start. Raise them later in `.env`, then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d mangosd
```

## Common commands

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f realmd
docker compose logs -f mangosd
```

Stop the stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Start again (keeps your database):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Reset the database (deletes characters and accounts):

```bash
docker compose down
docker volume ls
docker volume rm tortoise-docker_db-data tortoise-docker_init-marker
docker compose up -d
```

Volume names can include your Compose project name. Use `docker volume ls` to confirm the names.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| Login fails / unknown account | Wait for `World server is up and running`, then create the account again |
| Account create does nothing | mangosd is still starting; wait and retry |
| Realm list is empty or offline | Check that `realmd` and `mangosd` are up: `docker compose ps` |
| Client hangs after you pick the realm | Set `REALM_ADDRESS` to an IP the client can reach; world port is `8090` |
| Empty world / no NPCs | First database import failed; check `docker compose logs db-init` |
| No bots | Use `TAG=playerbots` and `AI_PLAYERBOT_ENABLED=1` |
| Client crash: interface corrupt | Use the published image from this project; do not strip Turtle addons |
